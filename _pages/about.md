**WE STUDY RNA-MEDIATED GENE REGULATION MECHANISMS AND DEVELOP GENOME ENGINEERING TOOLS**

> OPENINGS
* Two PhD positions (as of 1 Apr 2020)

> PREVIOUS STUDIES
* We solved the first crystal structure of DROSHA (Cell 2016) and elucidated the mechanism of primary microRNA processing using high-throughput sequencing (Molecular Cell 2019).
* We provided whole RNA-binding protein repertoire of embryonic stem cells (Nature Structural and Molecular Biology 2013).
