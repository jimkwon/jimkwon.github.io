**WE STUDY RNA-MEDIATED GENE REGULATION MECHANISMS AND DEVELOP GENOME ENGINEERING TOOLS**  
  
> **Open positions:** Two PhD positions (as of May 2020)
  
> **Previous studies**  
> * We solved the first crystal structure of DROSHA (Cell 2016) and elucidated the mechanism of primary microRNA processing using high-throughput sequencing (Molecular Cell 2019).  
> * We provided whole RNA-binding protein repertoire of embryonic stem cells (Nature Structural and Molecular Biology 2013).
