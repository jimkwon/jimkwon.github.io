> **Open positions:** One PhD position (Sep 2021)
  
> **Previous studies**  
> We solved the first crystal structure of DROSHA (**Cell** 2016) and elucidated the mechanism of primary microRNA processing using high-throughput sequencing (**Molecular Cell** 2019).  
> We provided whole RNA-binding protein repertoire of embryonic stem cells (**Nature Structural and Molecular Biology** 2013).
