We are looking for __two research postgraduate students__ (as of Jul 2020). We aim to train a PhD student to be able to (1) think independently, (2) perform biochemical/high-throughput experiments, and (3) analyze the data through his or her own Python scripts. Please feel free to contact *Chul* (chul at hku.hk) regarding the open positions in the lab.

We would like to note that there are attractive funding schemes such as "HKU Presidential PhD Scholarship" or "Hong Kong PhD Fellowships". Please find the link for further information. https://www.gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees
